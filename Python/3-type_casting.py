# TYPE CASTING:
# In Python, '12' is not the same as 12. The first is a string and the second is an integer.
# You can transform the string '12' into an integer through a process called type casting:
test = '12' * 2
test_2 = int('12') * 2
test_3 = str(30)
# You can add a string with a string, and a number with a number, but not a number with a string.
"Hello" + "World"
"Hello "*4
"Hello" + " " + "World"
("Hello" + "World" + " ")*2
# Trying to add a string with a number will throw an error:
"My favorite number is " + 8

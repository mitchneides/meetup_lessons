# BOOLEANS
# Booleans are binary operators, they are either True or False.
# They let you define an action based on the "truthiness" or "falseness" of a given statement.
# We tend to use them with comparison operators such as greater than, lower than, equal to
3 > 4
4 >= 4
3 < 4
'hello' == 'hello'
'hello' != 'hello'
# You can combine operators to test for multiple conditions
True and False
# False
3 < 4 and 2 > 1
# True
'b' == 'a' and 'c' == 'c'
# False
True or False
# True
3 < 4 or 2 > 1
# True
'b' == 'a' or 'c' == 'c'
# True

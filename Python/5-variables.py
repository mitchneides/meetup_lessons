# VARIABLES
# Variables are used to store temporary pieces of data.
# A variable is like a little box in which we can store anything (string, integerâ€¦).
#
# Every variable has a name and a value, the value can be any data type.
# We can use the content of our box to perform operations on the data that was stored.
#
# Why should we use variables ?
# Variables are here to make your code dynamic
# When programming, you want to be able to run the same piece of code but with different values
my_hair_color = "black"
print(my_hair_color)
my_number = 5
my_number += 4
print(my_number)
# Taking user input
# The input function lets us ask the user for their own input. This function always gives you a string in return.
number = input('Multiply me by three: ')
print(number * 3)
print(int(number) * 3)

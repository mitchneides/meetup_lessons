# TASK:

# I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 1000.
# Write a program that can guess my number in 10 guesses or less.

# With every guess the computer should receive input from the user: was the guess too high, too low, or correct?
# It should continue this pattern until it correctly guesses the number, at which point it should display how many guesses it took.

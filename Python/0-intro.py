# Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language.

# It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990.

# Python was designed for readability, & has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.

# Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use

# semicolons or parentheses.

# Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes.

# Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
